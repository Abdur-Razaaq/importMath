# importMath

This code defines a function that checks if a list of book counts can be organized by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the counts. It calculates the GCD of the entire list, and if the final GCD is greater than 1, it returns "YES", meaning the books can be organized. If the GCD is 1, it returns "NO", indicating they cannot be organized in that way.
